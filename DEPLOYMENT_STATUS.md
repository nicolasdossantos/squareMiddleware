## 📊 Current Deployment Status

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```
Workflow: Deploy to Azure App Service
Trigger: Push to main (commit e04ff295)
Status: Running...
```

**Check status:**
```bash
gh run watch
```

Or visit: https://github.com/nicolasdossantos/squareMiddleware/actions

---

## ✅ What Should Happen Now

The workflow will execute these steps:

```
1. ✅ Checkout code
2. ✅ Setup Node.js 20.x
3. ✅ Install dependencies (npm ci)
4. ✅ Run tests (509 tests should pass)
5. ✅ Azure login
6. ✅ Install production deps
7. ✅ Create deployment package
8. 🆕 Stop app service (NEW - prevents 409)
9. 🆕 Clear deployment locks (NEW)
10. 📦 Deploy to Azure (with clean=true, restart=true)
11. 🆕 Start app service (NEW)
12. ⚙️  Configure health check
13. 🆕 Verify deployment (NEW - polls /api/health)
14. ✅ Azure logout
```

---

## 🎯 Expected Results

### If Successful
```
✅ All 509 tests passed
✅ App stopped successfully
✅ Deployment completed without 409 error
✅ App started successfully
✅ Health check returned 200 OK
✅ Deployment verified
```

### Validation Commands (After Deployment)

```bash
# 1. Check health endpoint
curl -i https://square-middleware-prod-api.azurewebsites.net/api/health

# Expected:
# HTTP/2 200
# {
#   "status": "healthy",
#   "timestamp": "2025-10-20T18:05:00.000Z"
# }

# 2. Check Retell webhook signature verification
# (Should see in logs within next 5-10 minutes when Retell sends webhook)

# 3. Monitor Azure logs
az webapp log tail \
  --name square-middleware-prod-api \
  --resource-group square-middleware-prod-rg
```

---

## 🔍 What to Monitor (Next 30 Minutes)

### 1. GitHub Actions Status
- **Watch for:** Green checkmark on commit e04ff295
- **If fails:** Check action logs for specific error

### 2. Azure Application Insights

Query for webhook errors:
```kql
traces
| where timestamp > ago(30m)
| where message contains "circular" or message contains "409"
| project timestamp, severityLevel, message
```

Expected: **0 results**

### 3. Retell Webhook Logs

Query for signature verifications:
```kql
traces
| where timestamp > ago(30m)
| where message contains "[RetellAuth]"
| summarize count() by bin(timestamp, 1m)
| render timechart
```

Expected: **Steady rate, no spikes** (1 verification per webhook, not 18+)

### 4. Error Rate

```kql
requests
| where timestamp > ago(30m)
| where url contains "/api/webhooks/retell"
| summarize 
    Total = count(),
    Success = countif(resultCode < 400),
    Errors = countif(resultCode >= 400)
| extend ErrorRate = (Errors * 100.0) / Total
```

Expected: **Error rate < 5%** (should be near 0%)

## 🚨 If Deployment Fails Again

### Scenario A: Still Getting 409 Error

```bash
# Manual deployment via Azure CLI
az webapp deploy \
  --resource-group square-middleware-prod-rg \
  --name square-middleware-prod-api \
  --src-path deployment.zip \
  --type zip \
  --async false \
  --clean true \
  --restart true
```

### Scenario B: App Won't Start

```bash
# Check app logs
az webapp log tail \
  --name square-middleware-prod-api \
  --resource-group square-middleware-prod-rg

# Manual restart
az webapp restart \
  --name square-middleware-prod-api \
  --resource-group square-middleware-prod-rg
```

### Scenario C: Webhook Errors Continue

```bash
# Rollback to previous stable version
git revert e04ff295 63b1e938
git push origin main

# Or manual rollback in Azure Portal:
# Deployment Center → Deployments → Select cf5f2f32 → Redeploy
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

After deployment completes successfully, we should see:

| Metric | Before | After | Target |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Webhook Success Rate | ~0% | ~95%+ | >95% |
| Circular JSON Errors | High | 0 | 0 |
| Deployment 409 Errors | 100% | 0% | 0% |
| Retell Retry Rate | 18+ per webhook | 1 per webhook | 1 |
| Health Check Response | Unknown | 200 OK | 200 OK |
| Deployment Duration | Failed | 3-4 min | <5 min |

---

## 📋 Post-Deployment Checklist

After GitHub Actions shows success:

- [ ] Verify health endpoint returns 200
- [ ] Check Azure logs for startup errors
- [ ] Wait for next Retell webhook (5-10 min)
- [ ] Confirm webhook processes without errors
- [ ] Check Application Insights for circular JSON errors (should be 0)
- [ ] Monitor error rate for 1 hour
- [ ] Update this document with actual results

---

## 🎉 Next Steps

Once deployment is validated:

1. **Switch back to feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout code-quality-improvements
   ```

2. **Continue with code quality improvements:**
   - Consolidate duplicate webhook services
   - Split bookingController.js
   - Split squareUtils.js
   - Add circuit breakers
   - Add monitoring queries

3. **OR wait for production validation:**
   - Monitor for 1-2 hours
   - Ensure no regression
   - Then continue improvements
