# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Production Deployment & Fixes

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Time:** 16:27 EDT (Deployment in progress)  
**Status:** 🔄 **DEPLOYMENT RECOVERY IN PROGRESS**

---

## What Happened

### ❌ Production Outage (19:56 UTC)

- App crashed with: `Error: Cannot find module 'express'`
- Root cause: Azure excluded `node_modules` from deployment
- Impact: All webhooks failing, 503 Application Error responses
- Duration: ~30 minutes before fix deployment

### 🔧 Root Cause Identified

Azure's `azure/webapps-deploy@v2` action has a built-in rule that **excludes `node_modules`** from deployment
because:

1. Pre-built modules may not match Azure's Linux platform
2. Azure's Oryx build system prefers building on target platform
3. When Oryx sees `node_modules`, it skips `npm install` then excludes them

Our workflow was copying pre-built `node_modules` to deployment folder, triggering this exclusion rule → app
started without dependencies → crash.

## Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Remove node_modules from deployment (Commit b31807be)

**What we changed:**

- ❌ Removed: `npm ci --omit=dev` step
- ❌ Removed: `cp -R node_modules deploy/` line
- ✅ Result: Let Azure run `npm install` on server via Oryx build system

**Impact:** Dependencies now installed reliably on Azure's actual platform

### Fix #2: Extend verification timeout (Commit d38e6d6b)

**What we changed:**

- ⏱️ Initial wait: 15s → 30s
- 🔄 Health check attempts: 10 → 24
- ⏳ Wait between attempts: 10s → 15s
- Total timeout: **100 seconds → 390 seconds**

**Impact:** Deployment now waits for full npm install (~2-3 minutes) before failing

## What's Happening Now (Real-time)

```
20:25 UTC: Deployment workflow started
  → Tests: 509/509 ✓
  → Build and package created
  → App stopped
  → Files deployed to Azure
  → App started

20:26 UTC: Azure's Oryx build system activates
  → Detects package.json without node_modules
  → Runs: npm ci --production
  → Downloading ~100 npm packages
  → Compiling dependencies
  → Creating node_modules folder
  → [CURRENTLY HERE - ~1-2 minutes remaining]

20:28-20:30 UTC: Expected completion
  → npm install finishes
  → node_modules ready
  → App starts successfully
  → Health endpoint responds 200 OK
```

---

## How to Monitor

**Check health endpoint:**

```bash
curl https://square-middleware-prod-api.azurewebsites.net/api/health
# Will show 503 until npm install finishes, then 200 OK
```

**View logs:**

```bash
az webapp log tail --name square-middleware-prod-api \
  --resource-group square-middleware-prod-rg
```

**Check app status:**

```bash
az webapp show --name square-middleware-prod-api \
  --resource-group square-middleware-prod-rg \
  --query "{state:state, defaultHostName:defaultHostName}" -o json
```

---

## When Deployment Succeeds

**Immediate checks (should pass):**

- ✅ Health endpoint: `https://square-middleware-prod-api.azurewebsites.net/api/health` returns 200
- ✅ Version check: Response shows `version: 2.0.0`
- ✅ All dependencies present: No MODULE_NOT_FOUND errors in logs

**Next validation (next webhook):**

- ✅ Retell webhook arrives (call_inbound, call_started, call_ended, or call_analyzed)
- ✅ Webhook returns 200/204 (not 500)
- ✅ No circular JSON error in response
- ✅ Single signature verification (not 18+ retries)

---

## Production Fixes Already In Place

### Webhook Circular JSON Error (Commit 63b1e938)

- **Fixed:** Circular reference in error serialization causing "Converting circular structure to JSON" error
- **Solution:** Extract `error.message` instead of passing entire error object
- **File:** `src/controllers/retellWebhookController.js` (line 299)
- **Status:** ✅ Deployed, awaiting webhook test

### Correlation ID Tracking (Commit 63b1e938)

- **Added:** Correlation ID to all error responses
- **File:** `src/middlewares/errorHandler.js` (line 51)
- **Benefit:** Better error tracking in Application Insights

### Deployment 409 Conflicts (Earlier fixes)

- **Fixed:** Multiple concurrent deployments causing "409 Conflict" errors
- **Solution:** Stop app before deploy, clear locks, start after deploy

## Documentation Created

Three comprehensive analysis documents have been committed:

1. **DEPLOYMENT_FIXES_SUMMARY.md** - Overview of fixes and architecture
2. **DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_OCT20.md** - Timeline and real-time monitoring guide
3. **ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS_DEPLOYMENT.md** - Deep technical analysis and prevention tips

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 5 minutes)

1. ⏳ Wait for deployment verification to complete
2. ✅ Confirm health endpoint returns 200 OK
3. ✅ Verify app has all dependencies loaded

### Short-term (Next 30 minutes)

1. 📞 Wait for Retell webhook to trigger
2. ✅ Confirm webhook succeeds (200/204 response)
3. ✅ Verify no circular JSON errors
4. ✅ Check Application Insights for success metrics

### Medium-term (After webhook verification)

1. 🔄 Continue code quality improvements:
   - Consolidate duplicate webhook services
   - Split bookingController.js (1,494 → 5 modules)
   - Split squareUtils.js (1,145 → 3 modules)
   - Add circuit breaker pattern to Square API calls
   - Deploy KQL monitoring queries

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Azure Oryx Build System** has automatic exclusions for `node_modules`
2. **npm install timing** takes 2-3 minutes on Azure Linux containers
3. **Deployment verification** must account for full build time, not just startup
4. **Pre-built modules** can have platform compatibility issues
5. **SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT** already configured in our Azure app
